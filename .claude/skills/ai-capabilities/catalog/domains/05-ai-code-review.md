# AI Code Review & Quality

## What It Is

AI-powered tools that automatically review code for bugs, security vulnerabilities, performance issues, style violations, and architectural concerns. These tools go beyond traditional linters by understanding code semantics, business logic implications, and cross-file dependencies. They can review pull requests, suggest fixes, and even auto-remediate common issues.

## Why It Matters

As a solo operator relying heavily on AI-generated code, automated code review is your quality safety net. Studies show AI code review tools catch 42-48% more bugs than human-only review. For government contracts, code quality and security are non-negotiable: a vulnerability in a state system is career-ending. These tools provide the "second pair of eyes" that solo developers otherwise lack.

## Key Tools & Platforms

| Tool | Type | Cost | Notes |
|------|------|------|-------|
| CodeRabbit | PR review bot | Free (open source), $15/user/mo Pro | Best-in-class PR review. Understands context across files. Auto-reviews on GitHub PRs. |
| Greptile | Codebase Q&A + review | $30/mo starter | Deep codebase understanding. Can answer "why was this built this way?" Useful for inherited codebases. |
| Qodo (formerly CodiumAI) | Test + review | Free tier, $19/mo Pro | Generates test cases, finds edge cases. Strong at behavioral testing suggestions. |
| SonarQube + AI | Static analysis | Free (Community), $150/mo+ Developer | Traditional SAST with AI-powered rules. Industry standard for enterprise. |
| Snyk Code | Security-focused review | Free tier, $25/mo+ Pro | AI-powered SAST. Strong vulnerability detection. Popular in government contexts. |
| Amazon CodeGuru | AWS-integrated review | Pay per lines analyzed (~$0.50/100 lines) | Finds expensive code patterns, concurrency bugs. Integrated with AWS ecosystem. |
| GitHub Advanced Security | GitHub-native | $49/user/mo (included in Enterprise) | Secret scanning, code scanning, dependency review. Copilot autofix for vulnerabilities. |

## How It Fits Your Workflow

- **Kanban 1 (Demo Dev)**: Run CodeRabbit on every PR generated by autonomous coding agents. Catches issues before they reach your review session. Non-negotiable quality gate.
- **Phase 4 (Execution)**: Contract deliverables need security review. Snyk or SonarQube scan results can be included in deliverable documentation as evidence of quality practices.
- **Proposals**: Reference automated code review in your technical approach. Government evaluators value documented quality processes. Include specific tool names and metrics.
- **Clean Repository Standard**: AI review tools help ensure "no evidence of AI assistance" by catching AI-typical patterns (overly verbose comments, unnecessary abstractions).

## Current State of the Art

CodeRabbit has emerged as the leading AI PR review tool, processing over 5 million PRs monthly. It provides line-by-line feedback, security analysis, and even suggests refactoring opportunities. False positive rates have dropped below 15%, making the feedback actionable rather than noisy.

The integration of LLMs into traditional SAST tools (SonarQube, Snyk) has dramatically improved their ability to understand context. Traditional rule-based scanners flag "potential SQL injection" on every string concatenation; AI-enhanced scanners understand whether the string is actually user-influenced.

A key development is "autofix" capability: tools like GitHub Copilot Autofix and CodeRabbit can not only identify issues but generate correct patches. Fix acceptance rates are around 60-70% for security vulnerabilities and 50% for code quality suggestions.

## Learning Path

1. **Set up CodeRabbit** on your GitHub repos. Free tier is sufficient for solo work. Review its feedback on a few PRs to calibrate your trust level.
2. **Add Snyk to your CI pipeline** - `snyk test` in your build process catches vulnerabilities before deployment. Critical for government work.
3. **Read OWASP Top 10 2025** - Understanding common vulnerabilities helps you evaluate whether AI review tools are catching what matters.
