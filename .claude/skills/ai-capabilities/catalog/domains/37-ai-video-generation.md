# AI Video Generation

**Category**: Content & Communication
**Maturity**: Emerging
**Relevance**: Low

## What It Is

AI systems that generate video content from text descriptions, images, or other video. This includes text-to-video generation (describe a scene, get a video), video editing (AI-assisted cuts, effects, and enhancements), avatar-based video (talking head presentations), and video understanding (analyzing and summarizing existing video). Industry estimates suggest 40% of video advertisements will be AI-generated by late 2026.

## Why It Matters

Video generation has limited direct relevance to government contracting today. Government agencies do not typically procure AI video generation systems. However, it has niche applications: training video creation for agency staff, public communications content, and demo presentation videos. The primary value is awareness: understanding what is possible helps you identify edge case opportunities and avoid being surprised when an RFP mentions video capabilities.

## Key Tools & Platforms

| Tool | Type | Cost | Notes |
|------|------|------|-------|
| Sora (OpenAI) | Text-to-video | Included with ChatGPT Plus ($20/mo), Pro ($200/mo) | 1080p video up to 20 seconds. Photorealistic quality. Strong on consistent physics. |
| Runway Gen-3 Alpha | Text/image-to-video | $12/mo Standard, $28/mo Pro | Up to 10-second clips. Strong creative control. Motion brush for precise animation. |
| LTX Studio (Lightricks) | AI video production | $20/mo Creator | Full production pipeline: script, storyboard, generate, edit. Character consistency across scenes. |
| Kling (Kuaishou) | Text-to-video | Free tier available | Chinese-developed. Strong motion quality. Up to 2-minute videos. |
| HeyGen | AI avatar video | $24/mo Creator | Talking head presentations. 300+ AI avatars. 175+ languages. Good for training videos. |
| Synthesia | Enterprise AI video | $22/mo Starter, custom enterprise | Professional AI presenters. SCORM compliance for training. Used by Fortune 500. |
| Pika | Creative video AI | $8/mo Standard | Text-to-video, image-to-video. Creative focus. Lip sync, sound effects. |
| CapCut AI | Video editing | Free tier, $9.99/mo Pro | AI-powered editing. Auto-captions, background removal, effects. Accessible to non-editors. |

## How It Fits Your Workflow

- **Proposals**: HeyGen or Synthesia for video proposals. Some RFPs accept or even prefer video submissions. A professional AI-presented video is faster than filming and editing traditional video.
- **Kanban 2 (Teaming)**: Video introductions to potential teaming partners. A 60-second HeyGen video personalizing your pitch is more engaging than email.
- **Training Content**: If a contract deliverable includes training materials, AI video tools produce training content without videography expertise or equipment.
- **Low Priority**: This is a "nice to know" domain, not a "must track" one. Monitor quarterly for relevance changes.

## Current State of the Art

Sora (OpenAI) produces the highest-quality text-to-video output, generating up to 20 seconds of 1080p video from text descriptions. Quality is impressive for short clips but consistency degrades in longer sequences. Physics simulation (water, light, movement) is mostly convincing but occasionally produces artifacts.

The practical sweet spot is avatar-based video (HeyGen, Synthesia). These produce professional talking-head presentations reliably: consistent character, natural lip sync, multiple languages, and customizable backgrounds. Quality is indistinguishable from real video for training and presentation purposes. Government agencies use these for training content, public service announcements, and multilingual communications.

Full text-to-video (describe a scene, get a video) is impressive but not yet reliable enough for professional use. Consistency issues (characters changing appearance between shots, physics glitches) require manual selection from multiple generations. Expect 3-5 generations to get one usable clip.

Video understanding (analyzing existing video) is more immediately practical. Gemini 3 Pro can process hours of video within its 2M context window, enabling: meeting summarization, compliance video review, training session analysis, and security footage search.

Cost comparison: a 3-minute professional training video costs $5,000-15,000 with traditional production, $50-200 with AI tools (HeyGen/Synthesia), and $0-20 with text-to-video (Sora/Runway) plus significant curation time.

## Learning Path

1. **Create a HeyGen demo video** - Produce a 2-minute pitch video for your company using an AI avatar. Evaluate quality and production time. Keep this as a reusable asset.
2. **Monitor Sora and Runway quarterly** - The quality improvement trajectory suggests professional-grade text-to-video within 12-18 months. Watch for the tipping point.
3. **Test Gemini video understanding** - Upload a recorded meeting or presentation to Gemini and ask for a summary. This is the more immediately practical video AI capability.
