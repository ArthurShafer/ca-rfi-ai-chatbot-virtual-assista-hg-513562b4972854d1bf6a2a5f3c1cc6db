# AI in Government

## What It Is

The adoption, implementation, and impact of AI within government agencies at all levels. This encompasses how agencies procure AI, what use cases they prioritize, what barriers they face, workforce implications, and the policy frameworks they develop. Government AI is moving from experimentation and pilots to production deployment in 2026, with state agencies scaling successful pilots and issuing new procurements for AI-powered modernization.

## Why It Matters

This is your market. Understanding how government agencies think about, procure, and deploy AI is the foundation of your entire business. Every solicitation you pursue, every demo you build, every partner you court is shaped by the dynamics of government AI adoption. This domain is not about a specific technology; it is about the ecosystem in which you operate. The workforce gap (agencies need AI but lack AI talent) is your primary opportunity.

## How It Fits Your Workflow

- **Entire Business**: This is the context for everything you do. Government AI adoption trends determine which demos to build, which agencies to target, and which capabilities to highlight.
- **Phase 1 (Dashboard)**: Track government AI news alongside solicitations. An agency announcing an AI pilot today will issue an RFP in 6-12 months. Early awareness creates early positioning.
- **Kanban 2 (Teaming)**: Government AI workforce gaps mean agencies often prefer teaming arrangements that combine AI capability (you) with domain expertise (partners with agency relationships).
- **Proposals**: Reference government AI trends, case studies, and NASCIO priorities. "This aligns with NASCIO's 2026 priority of AI-enabled citizen services." Evaluators recognize this language.

## Current State of the Art

State government AI adoption is at an inflection point. Pilots from 2024-2025 are being evaluated for production scaling. The most common production use cases: chatbots for citizen services (DMV, benefits inquiry), document processing (permit applications, regulatory filings), fraud detection (benefits, tax), and internal knowledge management (policy lookup, employee self-service).

The workforce gap is acute. State agencies cannot hire AI engineers at market rates. This creates three opportunity models: (1) build and hand off (contract to build, train staff to maintain), (2) managed service (you operate the AI system as a service), (3) AI-augmented existing tools (add AI to systems the agency already uses, minimizing new skills required).

Procurement is adapting to AI. Traditional RFPs designed for waterfall software projects do not fit iterative AI development. Progressive agencies are issuing RFIs (Requests for Information) to learn the landscape, then structuring RFPs with agile-friendly evaluation criteria. Some are using "AI sandboxes" where vendors demonstrate capability in a controlled environment rather than submitting paper proposals.

New England state government AI posture: Massachusetts leads (MassTech initiative, dedicated AI strategy), Connecticut is active (AI legislation, digital services modernization), Vermont is progressive but resource-constrained, New Hampshire is cautious (smaller government philosophy), Maine is pragmatic (focused on specific use cases like DMV and natural resources), Rhode Island is emerging (new digital services office).

Budget cycles matter. Most state IT budgets are set in April-June for the following fiscal year. AI-related RFPs cluster in Q3-Q4 of the fiscal year (January-June) as agencies spend allocated funds. Understanding this timing improves your pursuit strategy.

Key barriers to government AI adoption: procurement complexity (takes 6-18 months from need to contract), workforce gaps (no one to manage AI internally), data quality (legacy systems, inconsistent data), security concerns (data classification, cloud authorization), and public trust (transparency, bias, accountability).

## Learning Path

1. **Read the NASCIO 2026 State CIO Priorities** report. Understand what state technology leaders are focused on. Map your capabilities to their priorities.
2. **Track GovTech and StateScoop daily** (5 minutes each). Build awareness of which agencies are moving on AI, who the key decision-makers are, and what use cases are being prioritized.
3. **Study successful government AI case studies** - Colorado DMV chatbot, New Jersey benefits fraud detection, California wildfire prediction. Understand what made these successful and adapt the patterns for New England.
