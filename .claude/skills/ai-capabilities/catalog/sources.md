## Source Evaluation Criteria

When adding new sources, evaluate against:

1. **Timeliness**: How quickly does it report new developments?
2. **Accuracy**: Does it verify claims, or just amplify hype?
3. **Relevance**: Does it cover your market (state gov, AI/ML, AWS)?
4. **Actionability**: Can you act on the information?
5. **Signal-to-noise**: How much filtering do you have to do?

**Add to this list**: When you discover a consistently valuable source, add it here with a date-stamped note about why.
