# Requirements Compliance Matrix

## Requirements Traceability

<!-- GENERATE: A table mapping each RFP requirement to a demo feature and compliance status.
  Source: intel.data.brief.requirements (each requirement becomes a row)
  Source: demo codebase scan (match features to requirements)
  Format:
  | # | RFP Requirement | Demo Feature | Status | Notes |
  |---|----------------|-------------|--------|-------|
  Status values: Met, Partially Met, Planned
  "Met" = demo demonstrates this capability today
  "Partially Met" = demo addresses part of the requirement, extension needed for full compliance
  "Planned" = not in current demo, included in extension roadmap with estimated effort
  Be honest. Evaluators respect transparency over overclaiming. -->

## Evaluation Criteria Alignment

<!-- GENERATE: A table showing how the proposal scores against each evaluation criterion.
  Source: intel.data.brief.evaluation_criteria (each criterion becomes a row)
  Source: demo features, company profile, technical approach
  Format:
  | Evaluation Criterion | Evidence | Strength |
  |---------------------|---------|----------|
  Strength values: Strong, Moderate, Developing
  For each criterion, cite specific demo features, company experience, or technical approach elements. -->

## Compliance Requirements

<!-- GENERATE: A table mapping compliance items to implementation status.
  Source: intel.data.brief.compliance (508/WCAG, CJIS, FedRAMP, etc.)
  Source: demo codebase scan (check for accessibility features, security measures)
  Format:
  | Compliance Item | Standard | Implementation Status | Details |
  |----------------|---------|----------------------|---------|
  Be specific about what's implemented vs. what would be added during full development.
  Reference specific technical controls (HTTPS, input validation, RBAC, audit logging, etc.) -->

## NAICS Code Alignment

<!-- GENERATE: Brief section confirming NAICS code coverage.
  Source: company_profile.naics_codes
  Source: intel.data.brief (identify relevant NAICS from solicitation context)
  List the applicable NAICS codes with descriptions. -->
