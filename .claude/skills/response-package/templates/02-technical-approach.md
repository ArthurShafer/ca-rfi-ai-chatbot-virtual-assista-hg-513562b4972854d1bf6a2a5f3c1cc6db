# Technical Approach

## Solution Architecture

<!-- GENERATE: 2-3 paragraphs + a component table describing the demo's architecture.
  Source: demo docker-compose.yml (services, ports, dependencies)
  Source: demo codebase scan (frameworks, languages, databases)
  Source: demo docs/architecture.md (if exists)
  Include a table:
  | Component | Technology | Responsibility |
  Name actual services, ports, protocols. Not abstract boxes. -->

<!-- GENERATE: If possible, include a Mermaid diagram or text-based architecture description.
  Source: demo codebase structure, docker-compose.yml service relationships -->

## Requirements Mapping

<!-- GENERATE: For each RFP requirement, explain how the demo addresses it.
  Source: intel.data.brief.requirements (iterate through each requirement)
  Source: demo codebase scan (match features to requirements)
  Format as subsections or a narrative walkthrough.
  Be honest: if a requirement is only partially addressed, say so and describe the extension path.
  Example:
  ### Requirement: Automated Document Processing
  The demo implements PDF text extraction using [library], with structured output via Claude API...
  **Status**: Met in prototype. Production deployment would add [specific extension]. -->

## Extension Roadmap

<!-- GENERATE: What the demo does today vs. what full contract scope would require.
  Source: intel.data.brief.requirements (identify gaps)
  Source: intel.data.brief.deliverables (full deliverable list)
  Format as a table:
  | Capability | Demo Status | Full Scope | Estimated Effort |
  Be specific about LOE per extension item. -->

## Integration Considerations

<!-- GENERATE: How the solution plugs into the agency's existing systems.
  Source: intel.data.brief.tech_stack_signals
  Source: intel.data.research.subject_website.tech_stack (OPTIONAL - may be absent)
  Source: intel.data.brief.compliance (integration-relevant compliance items)
  If research data is unavailable, use tech_stack_signals from the brief only.
  Cover: data migration, SSO/authentication, existing database integration, API compatibility. -->

## Technology Choices

<!-- GENERATE: Table of technology decisions with justification.
  Source: demo package.json / requirements.txt (actual dependencies)
  Format:
  | Layer | Technology | Version | Why This Choice |
  Justify each choice in terms the agency cares about: security, maintainability, cost, compliance.
  Reference intel.data.brief.tech_stack_signals if the RFP mentions specific technologies. -->
