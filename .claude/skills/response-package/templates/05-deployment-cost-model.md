# Deployment & Cost Model

## Infrastructure Overview

<!-- GENERATE: Describe the AWS infrastructure required for production deployment.
  Source: demo docker-compose.yml (map containers to AWS services)
  Source: demo Terraform files (if present)
  Source: intel.data.research.subject_website.tech_stack (OPTIONAL - for integration context)
  If research data is unavailable, base infrastructure on demo architecture only.
  Include a service table:
  | AWS Service | Purpose | Configuration |
  |-------------|---------|--------------|
  Name specific instance types, storage sizes, and regions. -->

## Monthly Cost Estimate

<!-- GENERATE: Three-tier cost breakdown.
  Source: demo docker-compose.yml, Terraform, requirements.txt / package.json
  Format:

  ### Development / Pilot
  | Service | Configuration | Monthly Cost |
  |---------|--------------|-------------|
  | **Total** | | **$XX/mo** |

  ### Staging / UAT
  | Service | Configuration | Monthly Cost |
  |---------|--------------|-------------|
  | **Total** | | **$XX/mo** |

  ### Production
  | Service | Configuration | Monthly Cost |
  |---------|--------------|-------------|
  | **Total** | | **$XX/mo** |

  Use realistic AWS pricing. Be conservative (round up).
  Include: compute, storage, database, networking, monitoring, API calls (Claude/Bedrock if applicable).
  Note: estimates based on demo architecture. Production sizing depends on actual user load. -->

## Level of Effort by Role

<!-- GENERATE: LOE table for full contract implementation.
  Source: intel.data.brief.timeline (period of performance, milestones)
  Source: demo complexity (number of services, integrations, features)
  Format:
  | Role | Responsibilities | Estimated Hours | Rate Range |
  |------|-----------------|----------------|------------|
  | Solution Architect | System design, integration planning, security architecture | | |
  | Full-Stack Developer | Frontend, backend, API development, testing | | |
  | DevOps Engineer | CI/CD, infrastructure, monitoring, deployment | | |
  | QA Engineer | Test planning, execution, accessibility testing | | |
  | **Total** | | **XX hours** | |

  Be realistic about hours. Government evaluators know what things cost.
  Leave rate ranges as ranges (e.g., "$150-200/hr") — actual rates depend on contract vehicle. -->

## Implementation Timeline

<!-- GENERATE: Phase-based timeline from contract award to production.
  Source: intel.data.brief.timeline (period of performance, key milestones)
  Format:
  | Phase | Duration | Activities | Deliverables |
  |-------|----------|-----------|-------------|
  | Discovery & Planning | 2-3 weeks | Requirements validation, architecture review | Project plan, updated architecture doc |
  | Development Sprint 1 | X weeks | [Specific features] | [Specific deliverables] |
  | ... | | | |
  | Deployment & Handoff | 2 weeks | Production deploy, training, documentation | Production system, training materials |

  Align phases to the RFP's period of performance.
  Include time for UAT, security review, and 508 compliance testing. -->
