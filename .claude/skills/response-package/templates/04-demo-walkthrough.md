# Demo Walkthrough

## Overview

<!-- GENERATE: 1-2 paragraphs describing what the demo is and what it demonstrates.
  Source: demo README.md
  Source: intel.data.strategy.demo_recommendations
  Set expectations: this is a working prototype, not a production deployment.
  Mention the tech stack briefly (e.g., "Built with Next.js and FastAPI, containerized with Docker"). -->

## Key User Flows

<!-- GENERATE: Walk through the 3-5 most important user flows in the demo.
  Source: demo codebase scan (identify main routes, components, API endpoints)
  Source: demo README.md
  For each flow, describe what the user does and what they see at each step.
  Format as numbered steps within subsections:

  ### Flow 1: [Name]

  1. Navigate to [URL/page]
  2. [Action the user takes]
  3. The system [what happens / what the user sees]
  4. [Next step...]

  [Screenshot: {description} — add to docs/screenshots/{filename}]

  Focus on what the user SEES, not implementation details.
  Include screenshot placeholders for each key screen. -->

## Feature Inventory

<!-- GENERATE: A comprehensive list of all demo features.
  Source: demo codebase scan (API routes, frontend components, configuration)
  Format:
  | Feature | Description | RFP Requirement Addressed |
  |---------|------------|--------------------------|
  Link features back to RFP requirements where applicable.
  Source: intel.data.brief.requirements (for the RFP requirement column) -->

## Try It Yourself

<!-- GENERATE: Instructions for running the demo locally.
  Source: demo docker-compose.yml, .env.example, README.md
  Format:

  ### Prerequisites
  - Docker and Docker Compose installed
  - [Any API keys needed]

  ### Quick Start
  ```bash
  git clone [repo-url]
  cd [project-dir]
  cp .env.example .env
  # Edit .env with required values
  docker compose up
  ```

  Open [URL] in your browser.

  ### What to Try First
  1. [First thing to do]
  2. [Second thing to do]
  3. [Third thing to do]

  Keep it concrete. The reader should be running the demo within 5 minutes. -->
